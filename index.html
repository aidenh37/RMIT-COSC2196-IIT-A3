      <h3>Aims</h3>
      
      <figure class = "figure-style">
          <img src="images/HOME.png" align="right" width="100%">
      </figure>
      
      <p>The project aims to develop a platform that aids the uptake of cycling as a method of transportation. A significant shift away from driving is needed to reduce worsening traffic congestion in our cities (Norman 2017), save individuals and businesses money, reduce carbon emissions, and improve general health and wellbeing (Better Health 2022). It is for these reasons that we aim to create an application that will be genuinely helpful for both existing and new cyclists. 

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>The single most important feature of the application will be the ability to report potential obstructions and other cycling conditions. This will allow users access to real-time information about the conditions and quality of certain routes. For example: Does this route contain potholes or tree roots? Is the route uncomfortable to ride? Does it require riding in fast-moving traffic? The goal is to give cyclists an excellent platform to be informed and to inform others about hazards, conditions, and possibly even benefits of certain bicycle paths and lanes.<br><br>
        One of the desired effects of Cyclopedia is to facilitate council maintenance reports concerning cycle routes. Reports and summaries could be sold to local governments and other organisations, outlining hazards and maintenance that need to be attended to on important cycle routes. Ideally, this will lead to an increase in the quality and safety of bicycle routes, which converts into increased uptake when handled appropriately. Currently, many cycle routes are not maintained to the same high standards as roadways, and the goal is to have a platform where these problems can be identified and forwarded to the relevant organisations to be rectified.  </p>

        <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
        <p>We plan to implement the project with mobile applications on both major platforms – iOS and Android - as the frontend and using Google Cloud Platform for the backend – including management of the large amount of data expected to be collected. </p>
<hr>
        <h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
        <figure class = "figure-style">
          <img src="images/ROUTE.png" align="right" width="100%">
      </figure>
        <p>The primary means of interaction with the mobile applications will be through a map. This map will highlight bike lanes and other cycling paths based on data available, and provide the user with the option to tap those routes for more information. Depending on the screen size and/or format, it may also be able to give them a preview of the information on the main map screen. 
          If the user taps one of the cycling routes, a page with more information about that route will appear. This page will include other users’ check-ins, including potential hazards reported, and any other information that is available to the program such as imagery, safety and comfort scores, and other relevant cycling conditions or comments (for example, “Path has a 15% slope”, “Riding on dirt is necessary”, “Path is very narrow in some places”). This information can be extremely helpful to riders if they are considering using a particular route; especially for the elderly or those with children, the ability to research the conditions of cycling paths will be very helpful</p>
          <p>This page will also have the option for the user to do 3 different things. The first is rate the path on different metrics such as safety and quality. The second is report cycling conditions for that path, as mentioned above. The third, and arguably most important, option is to report hazards and areas that need maintenance. For example, if there is a tree root in a dangerous location, if the path has become eroded in an area, or if there are potholes anywhere along the path. The user will be able to report problems like these to alert other users. This may include the ability to upload pictures, and also using the phone’s GPS to check the location of the user (to avoid fraudulent reports). One of the main parts of the business model of this app will be selling this information to government departments and other organizations to aid them with their maintenance reports and other administration, etc. <br><br>

          This app will also have a ‘favourites’ section, which will list the user’s favourite bike lanes, that they have either favourited manually, or just the ones that they frequently visit. This will enable to user to find them quicker, especially as they are more likely to want to see them.  
          
          When users enter the app for the first time, they will need to authenticate and/or create an account. We plan to use OAuth services for this purpose, which will make our app more convenient by allowing people to sign in with Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. Ideally there will also be an option to sign in simply with an email address and password.  
          
          In the application, there will be a settings page that allows the user to specify several different settings. These will include: </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Whether to push updates to notifications and/or email. </li>
              <li>Permissions for accessing the phone’s GPS. </li>
              <li>Permissions for storing user’s data. </li>
              <li>Permissions for accessing the phone’s camera. </li>
              <li>Language settings </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There will also be a user profile page in our app that (optionally) allows the user to enter information about themselves. Information such as gender, age, address, etc. Will allow the app to give them a better user experience, as well as being able to better and more accurately use the data that is collected (for example if people over 50 consistently rate the track more difficult, making sure we don’t recommend cycle tracks in Perth to someone who lives in Sydney etc.). </p>

      <h3>Web Applications</h3>
      <figure class = "figure-style">
        <img src="images/DALL·E 2022-08-22 23.16.43 - cyclists lappy.png" align="right" width="100%">
    </figure>
      <p>Our plan for this project also includes a web application. This web application will be used by local governments and other organizations to access the data that we collect from cyclists. This could include downloadable data/databases, and the ability to access summaries and other representations of the data. <br><br>

        For example, it may include a map with points on the map specifying where hazards have been reported, or which cycling lanes are the most popular or highly reviewed. It will also include graphs representing similar data, such as number of problems reported per lane, number of cyclists using different areas, and possibly even number of cyclists from different demographics. <br><br>
        
        This web application will require a sign in by the organisation. When an organisation or local government registers with us, we will give them a login and create an account, which they can use to log in and access the data that they are qualified to access.  <br><br>
        
        Before the user has logged in, the website will have information and pages about our services, including information about pricing and services for local governments and other organisations, contact details, and information and advertising about our app for people wishing to download it.  </p>
    <p></p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>While doing this project, we researched and investigated a number of different map software/API options. Google Maps, Apple MapKit and Mapbox are the options that we looked into.

</table> (Mapbox n.d.; Google Maps Platform n.d.; Apple Developer n.d. a)<br>
<p>There are 4 main options here:
  <ul><li>Use Google Maps for Android and Apple MapKit for iOS. </li>
      <li>Use Mapbox for Android and Apple MapKit for iOS. </li>
      <li>Use Mapbox for both applications. </li>
      <li>Use Google Maps for both applications. </li>
  </ul>
  Considering the above research, we decided that the best option is to go with Google Maps for Android and Apple MapKit for iOS. This is both a cheap option (MapKit is free) and is also accessible (users will be more familiar with these options) and easy to implement, as both apps will be using the native and recommended map software.

<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<figure class = "figure-style">
  <img src="images/cybersecuritykeyboard.jpg" align="right" width="100%">
</figure>
<p>For privacy and security reasons, the app will have the option to specify whether the user’s location and cycling history is stored with their account (as mentioned above). This is important idea and is so for the same reason that the information and cyber security of this app must be very good. If this type of data is leaked, it could lead to very bad implications for the people that have used the app and allowed their data to be stored.  </p>
<p>There are many options for cloud storage and backend services. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are all prominent and popular options for cloud storage and computing, and all have different pros and cons associated with them. Considering we will likely already be using Google Maps for significant parts of the app; it seemed like Google Cloud Platform will be the best way to go for backend services. This reduced the number of separate companies that we rely on, and also increases the ease of integration for our entire project.</p>

<h3>Product Story</h3>

<figure class = "figure-style">
  <img src="images/cycleclosed.jpg" align="right" width="100%">
</figure>

<p>There are many, many things about Australian life – and, particularly, cities - that need to change to have an effect against climate change. And, whilst an individual effort might not make much of a reduction in our cities’ CO2 emissions, a fast, societal change can make a big impact. </p>

<p>One regular activity many Australians undertake daily is the act of driving a (typically internal combustion engine-based) vehicle - whether it be to work or to the shops. As much as many motorists like to believe otherwise, our cities were not designed for the car, and each vehicle takes up unnecessary public space that is so important in our cities. If, in reality, cars have such a negative impact on our way of life, then why is it so difficult to switch away from driving as our primary means of transportation? </p>
<p>There are many reasons, however, the one that we need to focus on is this: Motorists have access to a plethora of information to assist them in making their trip. In New South Wales, the state government have an application called Live Traffic NSW that provides users with real-time trip information such as road closures, incidents, traffic conditions, as well as points of interest maintained as part of the road network such as rest stops. Motorists also have access to high-quality step-by-step navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze; the latter even supports real-time crowdsourced data. Even the humble street directory, plus large directional signage on the road, still provided a fantastic source of information for motorists in lieu of a smartphone. </p>
<p>Problem is, there is a large difference in standards of information between those making mostly petrol-powered vehicular trips, and those getting around by bike, despite repeated calls for increased cycling uptake to fight congestion and climate change. As a commuter cyclist, it’s difficult to find up-to-date route maps, as local governments that do publish a map rarely update them. Some recommend Google Maps – and, whilst this is fine in a pinch, routes suggested a frequently not suitable and don’t consider factors that are most important to rookies, like avoiding busy on-road routes. All too frequently, there is no way to identify route conditions like roadwork closures without first running into the blockage, adding time and effort to a potentially already extended commute. </p>
<p>That’s where Cyclopedia comes in – an application that could one day be the first source of cycling route information, negating the need for out-of-date maps, social media-based route information and car-first step-by-step navigation. </p>

<h3>Progress we have made</h3>

<figure class = "figure-style">
  <img src="images/figma.png" align="right" width="100%">
</figure>

<p>We have used Figma for prototyping in this project. Figma is a prototyping tool that allows you to create mock-up iPhone and Android apps and run them on a ‘simulator’; all in your browser or through the Figma app that is available on both Android and iOS. During one of our team meetings, we were discussing what artefacts we wanted to produce for the assignment, and we decided that we should draw up a layout of what the app should look like. During this discussion Aiden brought up using a platform like Figma to create a prototype. Aiden was keen to build this himself so we agreed that he would be the one to design and create the app using Figma</p>
<p> After that team meeting Adam wanted to look into Figma and see how it works and what it is mainly used for. At this point Adam was not intending on building a prototype as this was designated to Aiden, but as this is something Adam is interested in, he wanted to understand how it worked. Adam first started by looking at some of the community designs to get an idea of how Figma works and see how other people have used the program to design apps. He then went to Youtube and watched a few videos on the basics of Figma. After watching the videos and playing with the community designs, he had a fairly good understanding of how to create a basic design and how to link pages together to emulate how the app would work.</p>
<p>Adam started by creating a login screen. He had a few attempts at this due to it being the first time he had created something using Figma and was still learning how it works. He also wanted to incorporate the colour scheme from the logo into the app. He did this by using the blue that was in the logo as the background colour for the buttons on the login screen. Adam then moved onto the home screen; this is where he decided what pages/areas the app should include. He decided to add a Home, Profile, Favourites and Settings buttons to the bottom of the app.</p>
<p>The main screen consists mostly of a map view, with a search bar at the top. At this point we had another team meeting, everyone was happy with the prototype Adam had created and Aiden asked if Adam could continue with the work he had started. Aiden also asked Adam if he could add a few more features so the prototype could be used in the filming that was scheduled the next day for assignment 5. After that meeting Adam then added the map of the cycle path in Bicentennial Park at Homebush to the home page, as well as the report an issue/damage button. </p>
