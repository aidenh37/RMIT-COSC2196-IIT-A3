    <p>Every endeavour undertaken carries an element of risk, every aspect of life, including business. </p>
    <p>Although business risk is less likely to involve physical injury, not identifying and managing risk in business can result in the death of a business or business idea, therefore not looking into the risks and managing risks are a significant aspect of business operation and management. In this report, we will be looking into the risks associated with the development, launch and growth of the Cyclopedia app and its business model.  </p>

    <p>Our group communication processes have been very robust. From the beginning our group has communicated well, utilising applications such as Microsoft Teams. Following feedback from our first assessment, the group then adopted the use of Notion, to help with tracking and workflow planning to ensure internal deadlines were tracked and met. This allowed team members to delegate work, and track progress throughout the project accurately</p>
    <p> Regular scheduled and impromptu meetings via Teams video conferencing features allowed continued co-operation amongst team members to clarify issues and discuss the project and tasks to be completed.  Good communications and the willingness to help and share workload has been a key contributor to our group’s success. The ease of use of available collaborative applications, Microsoft Teams, Notion and GitHub, have ensure our project has been completed on time, with few complications and in a timely manner. </p>
