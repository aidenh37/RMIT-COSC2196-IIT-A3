        <p><b>Tools</b></p>

        <p>Four primary tools have been utilised in constructing this report: Notion, Figma, GitHub and Microsoft (MS) Teams. </p>

        <p>Following on from the previous report (Assessment 2), the group is largely familiar with the ins and outs of GitHub and MS Teams, as these were both tools introduced previously. GitHub has been used exclusively for the webpage component of the report, while MS Teams has been used for the development of the main PDF report. Using these tools to complete separate components of the overall assessment has helped reduce confusion and work duplication. Another benefit seen has been the ability to produce two distinct audit trails. Having these records of participation creates a simplified data trail, and reduced duplication of audit data.  </p>

        <p>Two new tools - notetaking and data storage application Notion, and prototyping application Figma - were introduced to the group for use in developing this report. Notion, being a note-taking tool, was used in conjunction with MS Teams as a way of collaborating on various ideas, storing references, and tracking tasks. Figma was utilised to develop a working prototype of the application, which was further utilised to gather feedback when testing the user interface with others, assisting in data collection.  </p>

        <p><b>Notion</b></p>
        
        <p>Being familiar with Notion and working to improve the group’s planning and note-taking efforts from the previous report, Aiden introduced Notion to the group almost straight away. He was also responsible for setting up a basic group workflow, including pages within Notion to track meetings, ideas, references, group member responsibilities, track contributed work hours and track group tasks. Despite reminders to use Notion, the group hasn’t quite gotten used to the tool just yet and Notion was arguably underused in the development of this report – however, all group members maintained an accurate record of hours contributed, which was useful in understanding how many hours of work are required in the future.  </p>
        <p>The Notion group can be accessed by using this invite: <a href="https://www.notion.so/invite/1e54fccc86b65a6c49c57b88772825d7c4d807c9">Notion Invite</a> </p>

        <p><b>Figma </b></p>
        <p>The user interface design and prototyping application of choice for this project was Figma. The tool was set up by Aiden as a trial and utilised by several group members (primarily Adam) in designing a basic user interface and a working prototype of the project. This was later used to collect feedback regarding the user interface, and to determine if the interface design was the best choice for our project moving forward. As none of the group members have previously used this application, there was a steep learning curve requiring a fair few more work hours than expected.
            The Figma designs can be accessed using this link: <a href = = "https://www.figma.com/file/9VNUpoes8eg2OdkrCP6SRa/Cyclopedia?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a> </p>

        </figure>

        <p><b>GitHub</b></p>
        <p>Aiden set up the initial GitHub repository, and Robert was the primary contributor to the group's website, as this was his chosen body of work to contribute towards the group assessment. As a result, the GitHub commit data is significantly influenced by one contributor. GitHub contains numerous analytical tools for its users and provides in-depth data on commits and code changes, as well as analytical data on individual contributors. The site also provides data on external traffic to your webpage, if made public. Our Github repository can be found here <a href = "https://github.com/aidenh37/RMIT-COSC2196-IIT-A3">Github Repository</a> </p>

<p><b>Lucid</b></p>
<p>Lucid is a wireframing tool that can be used to create UI and UX wireframes. Sean used this tool to create wireframes for the mobile application, and model the user experience of logging in and using the app. These wireframes were used to outline and analyse the example user stories for the testing section. </p>

        <p><b>Microsoft Teams</b></p>
        <br>
            <p>The PDF document component of the assessment was created and collaboratively worked on via MS Teams, with each team member contributing equally to this document. The contributor data on the use of MS Teams varies significantly, to reflect the contributions of each member as they completed their components of the assessment.  </p>

            <p>MS Teams provided not only a record of attendance but also provided an avenue for continued feedback and discussion between contributors as the work progressed. This might have had some influence on the meeting agendas, as much of the discussion was via the MS Team workspace outside of scheduled meetings, resulting in solutions and agreed changes. This resulted in less time in scheduled meetings. </p>
