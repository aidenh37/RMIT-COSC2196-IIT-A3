To enable the application to be produced at a steady but satisfactory pace, the project will be built in stages. Initially, planning and production will only consist of the minimum viable product (MVP) which will also be referenced as Stage 1. 

    Stage 1 of the Cyclopedia application will primarily consist of four major components: The backend, to be developed on the Google Cloud Platform to allow simple multi-platform access; The iOS mobile application, to be developed as a frontend; The Android mobile application, also to be developed as a frontend, and; The web application, developed as a frontend to be designed as a ‘dashboard’ for registered users to access and analyse reported data. 
    
    Stage 1 will also include several minor components that aim to enhance the user experience, or allow users to fix problems without needing to contact us. These include:
    <ul>
        <li>A social media presence, including YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, to: </li>
            <ul>Advertise the product </ul>
            <ul>Engage with the communities we operate in </ul>
            <ul>Advocate for better infrastructure </ul>
            <ul>Demonstrate the positives of cycling as a means of transportation </ul>
            <ul>Teach the communities we operate in how to use cycling as a means of transportation </ul>
            <ul>Demonstrate how the application is to be utilised </ul>
        <li>A website, including information such as: </li>
            <ul>Showcasing product features </ul>
            <ul>Contact information </ul>
            <ul>Instructions on how to access data collected </ul>
            <ul>User support, including a knowledge base/instruction manual </ul>
        <li>A forum, for use by the communities we operate in for general discussion around cycling, as well as user support and feedback </li>
        <li>A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) utility, for storing subscriber contact and sales information going forward </li>
    </ul>
    As the size of the database held will initially be too small to effectively sell to organisations, efforts will be prioritised in building a user base. The product will initially be completely free for all – the web application will only be available to registered users, primarily staff, and will not have any use until it is decided to begin selling the data obtained to organisations. As such, no payment processing will be required – however, billing provisions should be made.

<p><b>Mobile Applications </b></p>
The iOS application, as well as the Android application, will be a primary method of data input and provide utility to the user by accessing the main database stored in the backend and displaying the data: 

<ul><li>Data must be searchable and returned from the backend in a user-friendly manner </li>
    <li>Data must be viewable on a map, or in a list </li>
</ul>

Both mobile applications will be free to obtain from each platform’s respective application repository, and will not include advertising, at least initially. The application’s design should include provisioning for un-obtrusive banner advertising to be implemented in the future. 

Both mobile applications must adhere to their respective platforms’ user interface design guidelines to the best of our ability. Ensuring adherence to these guidelines will result in a cohesive user experience on either platform, whilst maintaining similar usage patterns should a user switch between the applications. The applications must be designed in such a way that no tutorial explaining the interface is required – although, a knowledge base will still be provided on our website to assist users if need be. 

Both mobile applications must be capable of taking reports from the user in a manner that does not require further explanation. Location inputs should be verified against the device’s current GPS position, to prevent inaccurate reports from being made. Users must only be allowed to submit images and text created at the time of input. Users must be offered the opportunity to submit as much information as possible, as dictated by the database in use for the location provided. 

Both mobile applications must allow users the opportunity to create an account with us using either Apple ID or Google Account single sign-on (SSO). Account information is to be received as dictated by the backend’s requirements, and stored in the relevant database meeting all Australian security and privacy regulations. Accounts need not be created to submit a report – inputs can be made anonymously if the user desires. 

Stage 1 mobile applications will not include any form of point-to-point navigation at this time, although provisions should be made to allow this feature to be added shortly after release. 

Both mobile applications should make use of modern development technologies, including Swift and Java programming languages, and Xcode or Android Studio IDEs respectively.

<p><b>Web Application </b></p>

</figure>

Although not intended to be utilised in full as part of Stage 1, the web application will be a key component of the project, as it will be the primary means subscribers (organisations) will access, analyse and export the data collected by users through the mobile applications. 

Similar to the mobile applications, the web application will provide utility to subscribers by accessing the main database stored in the backend and displaying the data: 
        <ul>
            <li>Data must be searchable and returned from the backend in a user-friendly manner </li>
            <li>Data must be viewable on a map, or in a list  </li>
        </ul>

        Further to this, the web application must be capable of providing overviews for each type of data stored, as dictated by the backend. For example, a subscriber must be able to view the number of reports received in a chosen geographical area on a graph, presented by months of the year. The exact options to be made available are yet to be determined. 
       
The web application must follow a similar user interface design to the Android application, and allow subscribers to not only access the data stored but also manage their user account. Unlike the mobile applications, the web application will not make use of SSO at this stage, nor will subscribers be able to manage organisation accounts for use by multiple staff. These are features that would be considered shortly after release, so provisions should be made in development. 

The web application must make use of modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

<p><b>Backend – Data Storage </b></p>

The backend will primarily serve as a means of storing the immense amount of data expected to be collected by the mobile applications, as well as personal information collected to maintain user accounts. It has been decided the backend will be based on the Google Cloud Platform, meaning all infrastructure maintenance is largely outsourced and can match demand at any given moment. 

For Stage 1 of the project, all data will be stored locally in Sydney or Melbourne if available. All data must be stored under Australian security and privacy regulations, as appropriate. Initially, it is expected three databases will be required to make the product operational, however, the expectation should be that more databases will be necessary. These three databases and some of their core values are outlined below, subject to change:

    </figure>

    <p>Similarly, for an Android version of the application tools like Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA would need to be used for the development of the app. It would likely be programmed in Kotlin or Java, which are the best and most popular programming languages for Android app development. A system like Gradle would be used to manage and build the project, and other tools like Vysor could be used for testing the app, or Firebase for things such as user authentication and information syncing (Demchenko 2020). Google also requires a fee of US$25 to register for use of the Google Play Console, which allows developers to publish to the Google Play Store. However, unlike iOS, it is possible for the Android application to be installed manually (sideloaded) by downloading the package from the website, however this has serious user experience and security concerns. </p>


<p><b>Skills</b></p>

    <p>This application will require experience using a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud for the back-end servers and data storage, as mentioned above. </p>

    <p>For building the web version of the application, experience with the chosen web frameworks and programming languages will be required. Skills using IDEs such as Visual Studio or VS Code will also be important. </p>

    <p>The iOS application will require skills in using languages such as Objective-C and/or Swift for writing the software, and extensive use of Apple’s iOS developer tools such as XCode and XCode Cloud for development.</p>

    <p>The Android application will require skills working with Kotlin, Java, or a related language for writing the code, as well as an IDE such as Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA for development. Skills using other Android development tools such as Gradle, Vysor, or Firebase could also be extremely useful. </p>

    <p>If the project were to grow and become more popular, staff would need to be hired with skills for jobs like customer service, moderation, and similar roles. </p>

<p><b>Outcome</b></p>

<p>The desired outcome of this application is an increased uptake of commuter cycling, as this application can help mitigate many of the problems associated with cycling. It will also bring a greater sense of safety given to users of the application, as they would be more likely to be aware of hazards ahead of time. In addition, they will have the opportunity to be able to plan their cycling commutes with a greater degree of certainty more comparable to travelling by car or public transport. The data provided by users of the application could also be utilised by those who maintain and upgrade the infrastructure to provide a higher quality of service to bicycle riders comparable to that experienced by motorists.  </p>
