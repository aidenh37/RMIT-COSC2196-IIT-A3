            <p><b>About Us</b></p>
            <p>In Control Totally is a Sydney-based company, with employees in multiple states. We are looking for a full-time staff to join our development team. 

            The product that we deliver is Cyclopedia. Our vision with Cyclopedia is to aid the uptake of commuter and everyday cycling by empowering and informing cyclists, bringing together the cycling community, and aiding local governments with maintenance reports. We are committed to helping cyclists in many ways, and our goal is to build the cycling community, as well as aiding and encouraging others to do the same.  
            
            We have employees working in person and remotely, and supporting our employees is very important to us. Whether you come into the office every day or only once a month, you will fit in well with our friendly and supportive team. We run a very flexible work flow, and willingly offer extra time off if and when you need it. </p>
<hr>
        <p><b>Full Stack Android Software Engineer </b></p>
       
            In this role you will be joining our small but motivated development team in further development and expansion of our main product Cyclopedia. In particular, you will be working on the frontend Android Application, while also ensuring that the backend connectivity is working smoothly. 
            
            As this job is working predominantly with Android development, at least 3 years’ experience with Kotlin/Java development is what we’re after. Ideally, you’d also need to have a good idea of what you're doing with Google Cloud Platform. 
            
            As with many jobs, a Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of Information Technology or similar is a definite plus, but we realize that many developers have amazing talent and skill that hasn’t been formalised, and we’re more than happy to take applications with no formal qualification at all! 
            
            The last thing we’re looking for is experience using and integrating REST APIs. This is an important part of our project, because we run maintenance reports for government departments and the likes, so it would be great if you have a bit of know how in this area. 
            
            Here are a few of the things you’ll end up doing in this position: 

            <ul>
                <li>Developing and testing our Android application (using predominantly Kotlin and Java). </li>
                <li>Improving and maintaining our existing Android codebase. </li>
                <li>Integrating the app with our backend (Including Google Cloud Platform) and other relevant APIs such as Google Maps and Apple MapKit, and our own internal and client-facing APIs</li>
                <li>Ensuring our services are functional and performant. </li>
                <li>Working with our helpful security team to provide maximum security and uptime for our users and other stakeholders. </li>
                <li>Working and cooperating with our team to provide the best possible experience and services to our users and employees alike. </li>
            </ul>

        <p><b>Cyber Security Analyst </b></p>
        In this role you will be analysing the security of our back and frontend products including Google Cloud Platform, Android and iOS apps, and webpages, and communicating your findings with our teams. Cyber Security is an extremely important matter, and at In Control Totally we are dedicated to giving our customers and stakeholders the best and most secure experience, with minimal downtime (or any other inconveniences for that matter!).  

            As you will be filling an essential role in our team, tertiary study in Cyber Security is desirable. For example, Bachelor of Cyber Security, Bachelor of Computer Science with a major in Cyber Security, or Bachelor in IT with a postgraduate diploma in Cyber Security.  that being said, however, we are extremely willing to consider applicants with other adjacent study or work experience. We’d be more than happy, for example, to hire someone with 4 years’ relevant industry experience. 
            
            Here's a little list with some of the things you’ll be doing in this role: 
            <ul>
                <li>Analysing and reviewing the security measures within the backend and frontend parts of our projects </li>
                <li>Checking that new releases and updates are working securely according to our standards </li>
                <li>Integrating the app with our backend (Including Google Cloud Platform) and other relevant APIs such as Google Maps and Apple MapKit, and our own internal and client-facing APIs</li>
                <li>Ensuring all our internal and client-facing APIs are secure and functional. </li>
                <li>Working actively with our teams to ensure the best possible experience for our users and stakeholders. </li>
            </ul>
