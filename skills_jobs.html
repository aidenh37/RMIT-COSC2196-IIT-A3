            <p><b>About Us</b></p>
            <p>In Control, Totally is a Sydney-based company, with employees in multiple states and territories. We are looking for a full-time Full Stack Android Software Engineer to join our development team. </p> 

            <p>The sole product that we deliver is Cyclopedia. Our vision with Cyclopedia is to aid the uptake of commuter and everyday cycling by empowering and informing those who ride, bringing together the cycling community, and aiding local governments with maintenance reports. We are committed to helping cyclists in many ways, and our goal is to build the cycling community, as well as aiding and encouraging others to do the same. </p> 
            
            <p>We have employees working in person and remotely, and supporting our employees is very important to us. Whether you come into the office every day or only once a month, you will fit in well with our friendly and supportive team. We run a very flexible workflow, and willingly offer extra time off if and when you need it. </p>

        <p><b>Full Stack Android Software Engineer </b></p>
       
            <p>In this role, you will be joining our small but motivated development team in the further development and expansion of Cyclopedia. In particular, you will be working on the frontend Android Application, while also ensuring that the backend connectivity is working smoothly. </p> 
            
            <p>As this job is working predominantly with Android development, at least 3 years of experience with Kotlin/Java development is what we’re after. Ideally, you’d also need to have a good idea of what you're doing with the Google Cloud Platform. </p>
            
            <p>As with many jobs, a Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of Information Technology or similar is a definite plus, but we realize that many developers have amazing talent and skill that hasn’t been formalised, and we’re more than happy to take applications with no formal qualification at all! </p>
            
            <p>TThe last thing we’re looking for is experience using and integrating REST APIs. This is an important part of our project because we run maintenance reports for government departments and the like, so it would be great if you have a bit of know-how in this area. </p> 
            
            <p>Here are a few of the things you’ll end up doing in this position: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Developing and testing our Android application (using predominantly Kotlin and Java). </li>
                <li>Improving and maintaining our existing Android codebase. </li>
                <li>Integrating the app with our backend (Including Google Cloud Platform) and other relevant APIs such as Google Maps and Apple MapKit, and our own internal and client-facing APIs</li>
                <li>Ensuring our services are functional and performant. </li>
                <li>Working with our helpful security team to provide maximum security and uptime for our users and other stakeholders. </li>
                <li>Working and cooperating with our team to provide the best possible experience and services to our users and employees alike. </li>

            <p>Here's a little list with some of the things you’ll be doing in this role: </p>
