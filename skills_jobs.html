        <p><b>Tools</b></p>

        <p>Four primary tools have been utilised in constructing this report: Notion, Figma, GitHub and Microsoft (MS) Teams. </p>
<hr>
        <p><b>Notion</b></p>
        
        <p>Being familiar with Notion and working to improve the group’s planning and note-taking efforts from the previous report, Aiden introduced Notion to the group almost straight away. He was also responsible for setting up a basic group workflow, including pages within Notion to track meetings, ideas, references, group member responsibilities, track contributed work hours and track group tasks. Despite repeated reminders to utilise Notion, the group hasn’t quite gotten used to the tool just yet and Notion was arguably underused in the development of this report – however, all group members maintained an accurate record of hours contributed, which was useful in understanding how many hours of work are required in the future. </p>

    <figcaption>Figure 2: Figma</figcaption>
</figure>
        <p><b>Figma </b></p>
        <p>The user interface design and prototyping application of choice for this project was Figma. The tool was set up by Aiden as a trial and utilised by several group members (primarily Adam) in designing a basic user interface and a working prototype of the project. This was later used to collect feedback regarding the user interface, and to determine if the interface design was the best choice for our project moving forward. As none of the group members have previously used this application, there was a steep learning curve requiring a fair few more work hours than expected. </p>

        <p><b>Microsoft Teams</b></p>

                <p>The PDF document component of the assessment was created and collaboratively worked on via MS Teams, with each team member contributing equally to this document. The contributor data on the use of MS Teams varies significantly, to reflect the contributions of each member as they completed their components of the assessment. Robert had the smallest contribution here, consisting primarily of small edits and updates on the progress of the website development to ensure it reflects the PDF document accurately, and to solicit team feedback. 

                    MS Teams provided not only a record of attendance but also provided an avenue for continued feedback and discussion between contributors as the work progressed. This might have had some influence on the meeting agendas, as much of the discussion was via the MS Team workspace outside of scheduled meetings, resulting in solutions and agreed changes. This resulted in less time in scheduled meetings.
