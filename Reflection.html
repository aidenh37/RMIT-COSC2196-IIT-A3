         <p>For this assessment, our group introduced a new note-taking tool Notion, where information crucial to the organisation of group tasks was stored. The introduction of Notion allowed us to easily oversee the progress of all the group members’ work. Alongside Notion, we continued to use MS Teams as the centre of communication for the assessment, and the combination of the two programs has allowed us to collaborate easily. </p>

         <p>Areas to improve as a group include time management and setting internal deadlines. While we worked to the assessment due date, there were no defined dates for our sections to be completed and ready for review. We were able to use Notion to set personal deadlines for sections we were working on, but these weren’t defined in group meetings or other communication, and tasks were sometimes prioritised incorrectly. </p>

         <p>Our meeting notes improved slightly from the previous assessment but are still lacking some content – such as sections for progress updates, goals, and blockers. Each topic should have time allocated in future, to ensure the group can gain the most benefit out of each meeting. </p>

         <p>The group has continued to have strong communications through meetings, within Notion, documents and messages. Having such strong communication and support methods between everyone allowed us to reach out at any time for assistance or clarification on any aspect of the project. </p>

         <p>The group has a strong work ethic and has been able to assist above their allocated tasks if required. Working in a group allowed teamwork skills to improve, encompassing communication and collaboration skills. </p>

         <p>Overall, the group have been able to produce an in-depth report under time constraints not previously experienced as a team. We worked well as a team to ensure everyone achieved high standard written and design work by the assessment due date, being able to directly message and comment on sections within the report helped in communicating this to members. </p>
         
         <p>The group have created a strong rapport between members which will be carried on through future courses and possibly lead to the creation of a fully working application that demonstrates learnings to potential employers or even investors.</p>

    <h3>Adam</h3>
        <p>I believe I was very lucky to be in this group for this course as we all worked well together. I have had other experiences in the past where groups don't work due to some members not being involved. This group was the opposite of that, we all wanted to do as much as we could to ensure all the work was not just completed but to a high standard. </p>

        <p>One thing that could be improved was our tracking of tasks. We used a tool called Notion for Assignment 3 due to feedback we received for Assignment 2. Even though we implemented this tool, we still did not use it to its full potential. For me, this came down to me not having enough time to learn how to use Notion properly. I found myself just going straight into the work I needed to do rather than spending time on something that was going to distract me from the main task. </p>

       <p>Time management was another area that we could have improved on as a group. Even though we felt we were on top of this assignment, we still had a few things to finish right at the last moment. </p>

       <p>One thing that has continued to surprise me with this group is the high quality of work that my teammates have produced. As previously stated, I have had bad experiences with group work, however, this team was a pleasure to work with during this course. </p>

    <h3>Aiden</h3>
        <p>Once again the group faced a bumpy start to the project due to an overlap with an Introduction to Programming assessment also due – however, our first meeting was the longest meeting we have had so far as a group, and this was a result of the numerous ideas presented. The group performed similar tasks to the previous assessment in this project, which allowed each person to continue to build upon learnings from the previous assessment. </p>

        <p>I believe that our note-taking requires improvement, as despite having a plethora of ideas to filter through, most were not recorded during the meeting in an effective manner – this is mostly my own doing. I also think I mis-prioritised my tasks as other group members were waiting on content I was required to contribute – prioritising better is something we should work on in the future. </p>

        <p>Overall, the group worked spectacularly well despite some burnout and I look forward to working together again. </p>

    <h3>Helen</H3>
        <p>Overall, we work well as a group, and we divide the tasks for the assessments between the group without any conflicts. The group is very supportive and will help in any way they can throughout the assessment process. </p>

        <p>Despite working with the group for several weeks now and learning from our first assessment that we needed to set internal deadlines, this didn’t carry through for our current assessment and towards the end of the project, there were still many tasks outstanding. We needed to allow enough time for the review of drafts and final versions without it feeling rushed. </p>

        <p>One thing that continues to surprise me is how well our group works together, every group member knows what is expected of them and is professional in the way we communicate with each other. </p>

        <p>Working in groups comes with challenges, the most challenging thing I find working in groups online, is the lack of in-person connection, it’s not the same sitting in front of a camera onscreen as the interaction you can have in person. Ideas and creativity seem to flow easily in person vs online. I feel it would be easier if it were a mix of online and on-campus.  </p>

        <h3>Joshua</h3>
        <p>I think we worked well as a group during this assessment and continued our good workflow from Assessment 2 well. We all had our responsibilities that we allocated early on, and we completed the required tasks quite well. One of the things we could have possibly improved is time management, as we are working on this assignment right up until the due date, whereas it would be far more comfortable to finish things early and have plenty of time to review (and rest!). </p>

        <p>I think it was also good how we split the workload to work to each other's strengths. Aiden, Robert and Sean did most of the work that was required on the Assessment 5 presentation as well as some work on Assessment 3, while Helen, Adam and myself did larger portions of Assessment 3. This worked out well because firstly Assessment 5 didn’t really need all 6 group members working on it, and secondly, we could each focus on a more specific task. </p>

        <p>I have enjoyed working with this group and getting to know some great people who are studying towards similar goals to mine. </p>

        <h3>Robert</h3>
        <p>The overall process of group work for this part of the assessment went very well. From the beginning of this course, our group has worked well together. Building on an already strong foundation, meant our group dynamic improved dramatically. Following a similar pattern as we know worked in assessment 2, we delegated work early without any internal conflict, and allocated work that favoured our individual strength and desire to learn.  </p>
        <p>With our introduction to tools such as Figma, Notion and increased confidence in MS Teams, our teamwork and communications improved, and some found a desire to take on other parts of the project to improve their knowledge in the use of a particular application.  
            Myself, I wished to continue to build my skills in HTML and CSS, so chose to continue with website creation and worked on the risk analysis of the project, as in my past career, this was one of my strengths. Allowing each team member to work on their preferred part, worked well, and allowed us to put together a high-quality report for this assessment.  </p>
            <p>Even though we become more confident in the use collaborative tools including Figma, Notion and MS Teams, Time pressures started to develop in this assessment, as we initially underestimated the depth of work required for this assessment, even though we set out deadlines and workload via Notion. We appeared to be a little bit rushed as the deadline approach. Allowing time pressures to creep into our project highlighted a failure to learn lessons from the past to set and stick to internal deadlines. Although overall I feel we have achieved our aims and produced a quality report. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Sean</h3>
        <p>I have enjoyed working with this group as every member was very proactive and productive and did what needed to be done, I believe we worked very well as a group and maintained our good workflow and group chemistry from the previous assessment. The introduction of Notion to self-assign work and document work progress alongside our usage of Teams for communication and weekly progress check meetings led this assessment to go over smoothly.  </p>

        <p>Areas to improve would be the same as last assessment, which is deadlines, I believe a deadline on when everything should be finished before the due date would have allowed us to polish up the assessment even more and avoided the time crunch feeling but as the group is awesome at getting things done this proved to not be a problem.</p>

        <p>One thing that surprised me about this group work was the assessment 5 presentation being filmed live and despite my social anxiety I agreed to meet up with the Sydney located group members and enjoyed my time filming with Robert and Aiden, it was very interesting to listen to them discussing all the camera stuff that I had no idea about. </p>

        <p>I have learned how important it is to have good group members and how to work well in a group setting and overall, this group was a very pleasant experience, and everyone has been wonderful I wish them well in future endeavours. </p>
