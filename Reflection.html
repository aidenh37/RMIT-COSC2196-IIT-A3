        <p>Overall, we work well as a group, we divide the tasks for the assessments between the group without any conflicts. The group is very supportive and will help in any way they can throughout the assessment process. </p>
        <p>Despite working with the group for several weeks now and learning from our first assessment that we needed to set internal deadlines, this didn’t carry through for our current assessment and towards the end of project there were still many tasks outstanding. We needed to allow enough time for review of drafts and final versions without it feeling rushed. </p>
        <p>One thing that continues to surprise me is how well our group works together, every group member knows what is expected of them and is professional in the way we communicate with each other. </p>
        <p>Working in groups comes with challenges, the most challenging thing I find working in groups online, is the lack of in person connection, it’s not the same sitting in front of a camera onscreen as the interaction you can have in person. Ideas and creativity seem to flow easily in person vs online. I feel it would be easier if it were a mix of online and on campus. </p>

        <h3>Joshua</h3>
        <p>I think we worked well as a group during this assessment, and continued our good workflow from A2 well. We all had our own responsibilities that we allocated early on, and we completed the required tasks quite well. One of the things we could have possibly improved is time management, as we are working on this assignment right up until the due date, whereas it would be far more comfortable to finish things early and have plenty time to review (and rest!)</p>
        <p>I think it was also good how we split the workload to work to each other's strengths. Aiden, Robert and Sean did most of the work that was required on the A5 presentation as well as some work on A3, while Helen, Adam and myself did larger portions of A3. This worked out well because firstly A5 didn’t really need 6 people working on it, and secondly we could each focus on a more specific task.  </p>
        <p>I have enjoyed working with this group and getting to know some great people who are studying towards similar goals to myself.  </p>

        <h3>Robert</h3>
        <p>The overall process of group work for this part of the assessment went very well. From the beginning of this course, our group has worked well together. Building on an already strong foundation, meant our group dynamic improved dramatically. Following a similar pattern as we know worked in assessment 2, we delegated work early without any internal conflict, and allocated work that favoured our individual strength and desire to learn.  </p>
        <p>With our introduction to tools such as Figma, Notion and increased confidence in MS Teams, our teamwork and communications improved, and some found a desire to take on other parts of the project to improve their knowledge in the use of a particular application.  
            Myself, I wished to continue to build my skills in HTML and CSS, so chose to continue with website creation and worked on the risk analysis of the project, as in my past career, this was one of my strengths. Allowing each team member to work on their preferred part, worked well, and allowed us to put together a high-quality report for this assessment.  </p>
            <p>Even though we become more confident in the use collaborative tools including Figma, Notion and MS Teams, Time pressures started to develop in this assessment, as we initially underestimated the depth of work required for this assessment, even though we set out deadlines and workload via Notion. We appeared to be a little bit rushed as the deadline approach. Allowing time pressures to creep into our project highlighted a failure to learn lessons from the past to set and stick to internal deadlines. Although overall I feel we have achieved our aims and produced a quality report. </p>
