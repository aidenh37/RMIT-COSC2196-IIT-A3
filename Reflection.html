        <p>Overall, we work well as a group, we divide the tasks for the assessments between the group without any conflicts. The group is very supportive and will help in any way they can throughout the assessment process. </p>
        <p>Despite working with the group for several weeks now and learning from our first assessment that we needed to set internal deadlines, this didn’t carry through for our current assessment and towards the end of project there were still many tasks outstanding. We needed to allow enough time for review of drafts and final versions without it feeling rushed. </p>
        <p>One thing that continues to surprise me is how well our group works together, every group member knows what is expected of them and is professional in the way we communicate with each other. </p>
        <p>Working in groups comes with challenges, the most challenging thing I find working in groups online, is the lack of in person connection, it’s not the same sitting in front of a camera onscreen as the interaction you can have in person. Ideas and creativity seem to flow easily in person vs online. I feel it would be easier if it were a mix of online and on campus. </p>

        <p>I think we worked well as a group during this assessment, and continued our good workflow from A2 well. We all had our own responsibilities that we allocated early on, and we completed the required tasks quite well. One of the things we could have possibly improved is time management, as we are working on this assignment right up until the due date, whereas it would be far more comfortable to finish things early and have plenty time to review (and rest!).  </p>
        <p>I have enjoyed working with this group and getting to know some great people who are studying towards similar goals to myself.  </p>
